# Getting Started in the Archive 

Welcome to the _President's Cup Gameboard Archive_! Here, players can practice President's Cup challenges from past competitions as a team or as an individual. All of the game cards are on the [Archive home page](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/archive) organized by round from last year's competition. 

The archived challenges are presented in as close to original form as possible. Any changes made to a challenge to prepare it for this site are documented in that challenge's instructions.

If you are a player who has competed in a previous year's competition, use the same email address and password here in the archive as before. If you don't remember your password, you'll have the opportunity to reset it during login. If you are brand new, then you'll need to register and enroll. 

Please review the [Rules](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/#rules) and [FAQ](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/#faq) before starting a practice session. Read on below for how to get started and how to get support.

All gameboards are open to 1-5 participants. So you can optionally join up as a team or go it alone. 

Look for more President's Cup seasons (2019-2020) to be added over time!

## Get Support

Customer support in the archive is *not* the same as it is during an official President's Cup competition. President's Cup support engineers will try to solve any problem you have - however, responses won't be as timely as they are during competition. Thank you for understanding and patience. 

Problems should be reported via the game's integrated support ticket system. Players can create support tickets from a deployed challenge or from the Support link in the navigation bar. 

**In a deployed challenge:** below the Challenge Questions, click **Create Ticket**. By default, the challenge name, support code, and game are included in the new ticket. Complete the remaining fields (be sure to add a screenshot if applicable) and click **Submit**.

**In the top navigation bar:** click the **Support** link then **Create Ticket**. When a game is in session and a challenge deployed, the challenge name, support code, and game can be selected. Complete the remaining fields and click **Submit**.

The **Support** link is also where players go to view, update, and track the status of tickets they submitted.

> _**Reminder:** The challenge Support Code can be found in the lower-right corner of the challenge pane. The Support Code looks similar to this: `13d5a7a0 a03`. It's always helpful to have that code._
