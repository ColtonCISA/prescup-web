## Get Support

President's Cup V uses an [integrated support ticket system](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/gb/support/tickets). Players can create support tickets from a deployed challenge or from the [Support link](https://presidentscup.cisa.gov/gb/support/tickets) in the navigation bar. 

**In a deployed challenge:** below the Challenge Questions, click **Create Ticket**. By default, the challenge name, support code, and game are included in the new ticket. Complete the remaining fields (be sure to add a screenshot if applicable) and click **Submit**.

**In the top navigation bar:** click the **Support** link then **Create Ticket**. When a game is in session and a challenge deployed, the challenge name, support code, and game can be selected. Complete the remaining fields and click **Submit**.

The **Support** link is also where players go to view, update, and track the status of tickets they submitted.

> _**Reminder:** The challenge Support Code can be found in the lower-right corner of the challenge pane. The Support Code looks similar to this: `a347c5c6 a00`. It's always helpful to have that code._
